7.1 - Jan 23, 2002
============================================================================
Log Import
----------
- Logs greater than approx. 100,000 QSOs were truncated and not completely
  written. Fixed. Tnx VE6JY. Writing BV7 logs optimized and it is about 10x
  faster now!
- BV Version 3 & 4 and Swisslog import wasn't working. Fixed. Tnx DJ9MH.
- Import of DXBase, OH2GI, OH1AA, FINTEST added again.
- Number of read errors (faulty QSO's) and duplicate QSO's added to the
  conversion report.
- Warning if you want to overwrite a BV log that is still open.

Log Export
----------
- ASCII output is fully working now including the fixed column export type.

Log Window
----------
- New option "No date" in the "Set QSL sent/rcvd date" dialog. Tnx G4BWP.
  With this option, the "QSL sent/received" column is not filled with a
  date when filling the print queue.
- Changing the QSL sent and received flags (F8/F9) sets the QSL sent and
  received date now. Setting the flags to "N" or "!", empties the QSL sent and
  received date.
- New option: you can fill the entire log with QSL Managers from the BV QSL
  manager database now if you cannot import your manager information through
  the log import. Use the "Fill entire log with QSL Managers" command in the
  Log menu. This automatic function tries to fill only those QSO's that don't
  have a manager yet. It can be aborted at any time by pressing the Escape
  key.
- Changing the log index (F5): When switching from Call index to Date index,
  the date of the current QSO is taken as default for the date index.
  New function key Shift-F5 to switch back.
- Editing a call: if only one QSO is in the log for a call, and that call is
  edited, after saving the edits, an error window pops up saying "The call
  does not exist". Fixed. Tnx N3SL.
- Splash screen changed.

Label Designer
--------------
- "Manager" field was mixed up with "My Call" field in datafield properties
  dialog. Tnx DF2PI.
- The Log Window couldn't get the focus if there were no logs open and if
  the Designer Window had the focus.


7.2 - Feb 5, 2002
============================================================================
Printing
--------
A major bug in the print core routine was fixed which had caused a number of
strange print errors and behavior. Prining ranges of pages and start printing
at label position # (F12) should work perfectly now.

Configuration
-------------
Option "Merge QSOs in print queue and/or from different logs into one label"
reintroduced. See "Configuration | Sorting". This option is set by default.
If you have a QSO for e.g. DF3CB in the print queue and if you add another
QSO for DF3CB later, this additonal QSO is also put on the same label then
if there are still free QSO lines left. If there are no free QSO lines left,
a new label is started. If this option is not checked, every additional QSO
will automatically be printed on a new label.

Log Import
----------
- Import of K1EA CT RES Files added again.
- Import of all YPLog versions now supported. Tnx OK1RR. Import of QSL managers
  from the log added.
- The import of all ASCII type logs (ADIF, ASCII text files, Cabrillo, NA, TRLog)
  plus YPLog is 6x faster now!

--------
If the print queue was sorted "First in, first out", only one single label
was printed.

Log Import
----------
Several wrong conversions of VHF/UHF/SHF bands/frequencies fixed.

Label Designer
--------------

  dialogs.

  feature will follow.

  has to be decoded instead. Several UHF/SHF frequencies were not decoded.
  Fixed.
- Cabrillo import revised.
- LogPlus! import is not working everywhere yet. QRX.

Log Import
----------
- G4ZFE log output fixed. Band and mode were trimmed so that e.g. CW QSOs
